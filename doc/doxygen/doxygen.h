 *  The main namespace for the project.
 *
 *  \namespace detail
 *  The contents of this namespace isn't intended for general consumption: it
 *  contains implementation details, not the interface.
 *  It is recommended giving details their own file and tucking it away in a
 *  detail folder.

// This is a global "project documentation" file that supplies the front page
// docs for the project, sets up the groups (for use with /ingroup tags) and
// documents the namespaces all in one place. This allows all the "overviews"
// to be held in one logical place rather than scattered to the winds.
