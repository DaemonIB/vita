VITA <http://www.vita.cc/>

These are the release notes for Vita.  Read them carefully, as they tell you
what this is all about, explain how to install the software and what to do if
something goes wrong.

OVERVIEW

  Vita is a scalable, high performance C++ environment / toolkit for
  classification, symbolic regression, content base image retrieval, data mining
  and agent control.

  It's distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the accompanying
  COPYING file for more details.

REQUIREMENTS

  Vita is designed to have fairly minimal requirements to build and use with
  your projects, but there are some.  Currently, we support Linux and Windows.
  We will also make our best effort to support other platforms (e.g. Mac OS X,
  Solaris, AIX, Cygwin).
  However, since core members of the Vita project have no access to these
  platforms, Vita may have outstanding issues there.  If you notice any
  problems on your platform, please notify vita@googlecode.com. Patches for
  fixing them are even more welcome!

  ### Linux requirements ###

  * GNU-compatible make;
  * POSIX-standard shell;
  * Boost library (<http://www.boost.org>);
  * A C++98-standard-compliant compiler.

  ### Windows requirements ###

  * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010

GETTING THE SOURCE

  There are two primary ways of getting Vita's source code: you can download a
  stable source release in your preferred archive format or directly check out
  the source from the Mercurial (HG) repositary.
  The HG checkout requires a few extra steps and some extra software packages
  on your system, but lets you track the latest development and make patches
  much more easily, so we highly encourage it.

  ### Source Package ###

  Vita is released in versioned source packages which can be downloaded from
  the download page [1].  Several different archive formats are provided, but
  the only difference is the tools used to manipulate them, and the size of the
  resulting file.  Download whichever you are most comfortable with.

  Once the package is downloaded, expand it using whichever tools you prefer
  for that type.  This will result in a new directory with the name
  "vita-X.Y.Z" which contains all of the source code.  Here are some examples
  on Linux:

    tar -xvJf vita-X.Y.Z.txz
    tar -xvjf vita-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2
    unzip vita-X.Y.Z.zip

  ### HG Checkout ###

  Run the following Mercurial command:

    hg clone https://vita.googlecode.com/hg/ vita

SETTING UP THE BUILD

  If they are not already installed, you need the following libraries:

  * BOOST (<http://www.boost.org>)

  Vita needs Boost's Program Options Library to compile.

  ### Linux ###

  cd vita-X.Y.Z

  * To build the kernel library: make TARGET=kernel
  * To build the sr tool:        make TARGET=sr
  * To build test n:             make TARGET=testn
  * To build example n:          make TARGET=examplen

  If you see errors, try to tweak the contents of Makefile to make them go
  away.
  All output files will per default be stored together with the source code.

  ### Windows ###

  You should use the project file.
