    This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have contributed to
    the Vita project.
    It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification
    by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W), PGP key ID and
    fingerprint (P), description (D) and snail-mail address (S).

    Thanks,
                        Manlio
