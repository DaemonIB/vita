# 1. Summary and description should be wrapped to 76 characters. #-symbol
#    above is a marker for that.
# 2. Optionally, reference a ticket number.
#
# --------------------
# Tag can be:
# - [FIX] bug fix
# - [ADD] new feature or extended functionality
# - [DOC] for all kinds of documentation-only related commits
# - [REF] refactoring that doesn't include any changes in features
# - [FMT] formatting only (spacing...)
# - [TEST] related to test code only
# - [MAK] repository related changes (e.g. changes in the ignore list)
#
# --------------------
# Remember to
# - Capitalize the subject line
# - Summary is in 3rd person declarative / descriptive rather than 2nd
#   person imperative / prescriptive
# - Do not end the subject line with a period
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line
